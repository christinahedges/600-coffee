Dear {{name1}} and {{name2}},

This is an automated email from {robot_name} that has paired you for a random
"coffee" meeting in the next two weeks. This program is designed to introduce
you to people in 660 by encouraging you to set up
brief one-on-one coffee meetings with a new person every 2 weeks. The hope is
that this will help identify common interests, foster new collaborations,
and meet new people at GSFC.

This email is here to encourage you two to arrange a short (think 15 minutes)
informal meeting some time in the next two weeks. If you are both in the office
and both feel comfortable with it, feel free to arrange an in-person meeting,
but make sure that you follow the recommended COVID safety procedures!

FYI, {{name1}}{{pronouns1}}{{topics1}} works in Code {{code1}}, and
 {{name2}}{{pronouns2}}{{topics2}} works in Code {{code2}}. {{name1}}'s email is
 {{email1}} and {{name2}}'s email is {{email2}}.

You're welcome to ignore or postpone the meeting suggestion for any reason, but
do try to let each other know if you can't make it because you won't be
paired by Coffee Roulette again!

You can opt out of this program by changing your response to the sign up form here: {form_url}

Enjoy your coffee, tea, or similar!
